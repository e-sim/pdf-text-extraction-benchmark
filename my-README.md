As of June 2019 the following tools do not work on patas: pdftoxml, pdf2xml, LA-PdfText, pdf-extract, grobid.

The following of those tools may work if you [download? clone the repo?] [work on another computer?]: LA-pdftext, pdf-extract, grobid.

The following tools I was unable to get working in any environment: pdftoxml, pdf2xml.  The error message is as follows: Can't locate XML/Writer.pm in @INC [insert rest of error]

You can find the original research papers presenting many of these tools under /docs/tool_papers.


Further documentation, including [a more in-depth write-up as well as] Bast & Korzen's 2017 paper and original README, can be found under /docs.
